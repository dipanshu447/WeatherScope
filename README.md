# 🌦️ WeatherScope

A beautiful, responsive Weather App built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, powered by the **OpenWeatherMap API** and deployed securely using **Vercel**. This project fetches real-time weather data based on user location or city search, displays relevant information with dynamic visuals, and even allows users to capture a screenshot of the current weather UI.

- 🔐 **Secure API Key Handling with Serverless Functions (Vercel)**

## 🧠 What I Learned

This is the first project where I worked with a real API, and it has been a wonderful experience. I learned:

- How to use and fetch data from REST APIs
- Integrating search bars and handling user input
- Using `localStorage` in JavaScript to store recent searches
- Working with tools like **Postman** to experiment with APIs
- Leveraging **html2canvas** to take screenshots of the UI
- Setting up and using **serverless functions** to hide API keys
- Deploying a complete full-stack project using **Vercel**

This project gave me a lot of new hands-on experience, and a deeper understanding of frontend development and API integration.
